# TIMELAPPS by PLOTSKLAPPS

Timelapps is a Flutter application that offers two useful features:
TimeTimer and NoiseLight.
It is designed for educational or work purposes, providing intuitive tools
to enhance productivity.

## TimeTimer

A TimeTimer is a visual timer that helps users keep track of time-based events
such as school or work tasks, hobbies, or any activity that requires monitoring
elapsed time. The TimeTimer presents a colored disk that gradually disappears
as time elapses, offering a clear visual representation of the remaining time.

## NoiseLight

The NoiseLight feature serves as a visual indicator of the allowed voice volume
in a room. Designed in the shape of a traffic light, it provides an
easy-to-understand and enjoyable way to maintain appropriate noise levels
during meetings, classes, or any situation where noise control is necessary.

## PWA

Timelapps is developed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using Flutter.
This means it can be started and/or installed on ANY device and ANY platform
directly from your browser without requiring additional app downloads. It also
supports offline usage and ensures you always have access to the latest version.

## Features

Timelapps offers high customizability and versatility beyond its primary
functionalities. Apart from being used as a TimeTimer and NoiseLight toolset,
it can also serve as a Pomodoro timer or simple stopwatch if desired.
The app adapts responsively to fit various screen sizes seamlessly – even
large screens like digiboards commonly found in schools are fully supported.

## Open Source

Timelapps proudly follows an open-source approach. The complete source code
is available on GitHub at https://www.github.com/plotsklapps/timelapps for
anyone interested in exploring or contributing to its development efforts.
Furthermore, Timelapps will always remain free – no ads, subscriptions, or
in-app purchases are present within the app itself.
If you find value in using Timelapps and wish to support its ongoing
development, you can make a donation through the app's built-in donation button.

We welcome any feedback, remarks, or suggestions you may have to further
enhance Timelapps.

## Contributing

Contributing to Timelapps is highly encouraged and appreciated. I am a
solo developer and would love to see this project grow with the help of
the Flutter community.
